# Grypothrix_PCA
Morphological Dataset for Grypothrix Principal Components Analysis

Dataset used in: Two New Species of Thelypteridaceae from the Solomon Islands
by Susan Fawcett, Alan Smith and Cheng-Wei Chen, published in the American Fern Journal

The present study is based on examination of morphological traits using
herbarium material, including specimens from UC, TAIF, VT and MICH, and
digitized specimens available through the Pteridophyte Collections
Consortium (pteridoportal.org), JSTOR Global Plants and the Global
Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF 2022), and informed by molecular
phylogenetic data published by Fawcett et al. (2021), available on Dryad
(Fawcett et al. 2022).

            Morphological trait measurements were made from 19
            accessions of Grypothrix, representing G. cuspidata, G.
            liukiuense, G. ramosii, and the putative new species. Ten
            macromorphological traits representing continuous variables
            included 1) the length and 2) width of terminal pinna, the
            3) length and 4) width of proximal pinnae (excluding
            pinna-stalk), length to width ratio of 5) terminal and 6)
            proximal pinnae, and 7) ratio of the length of the terminal
            pinna to that of the proximal pinna, 8) number of pinna
            pairs, 9) angle of terminal pinna base, and 10) angle of
            proximal pinna base (these measurements taken 1cm from
            base). Two micromorphological traits included 1) the number
            of hairs per 1cm sq. of abaxial lamina and 2) number of
            setae per 10 sporangia. These data were gathered from 15
            specimens in UC and one from TAIF using a ruler and
            protractor, and from digital images of the type specimens
            using ImageJ (Rasband 2022). Only the macromorphological
            traits could be measured from the digitized type specimens.

            A principal components analysis (PCA) was performed using
            ClustVis (Metsalu & Vilo 2015) using the singular value
            decomposition (SVD) PCA with imputation for missing values.
            The plot was edited in Adobe Photoshop to indicate the
            position of type specimens.
